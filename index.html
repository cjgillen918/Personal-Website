  <p>I am a first generation immigrant born in Valikystyug Russia of Romani (gypsy) descent. I have 5 siblings, three live in Russia and two live in the U.S.
    I am a music/film lover,tattoo enthusiast and historian. My historical intrests are WWI, the roaring 20's, the prohibition era, and the rise of organized crime.
    I currently have intrests in being a full stack developer with a concentration in web & app design.</p>

  <p> My music intrests started with the blues and lead me to really dive into the origins rock and roll. The blues has really influenced music as we know it today and I feel that we need to keep the music alive.
    As a historian the making of songs and concept behind albums really captures me. I think just investigating an artists process and how they cultivated unbelievable work really puts you in there shoes; it gives you a great perspective. </p>

  <p> I started getting tattoos when I was 19 years old when I was away at school in Rhode Island. My first one was an anchor and it took off from there, in a 2 month period I had gotten four tattoos. I tend to pick large pieces that incorporate pop
    culture,music,and my roots. I stick to black and grey I've been very fortunate to work with great artists;some award winning. My goal is to get a tattoo in every country that I travel to. I think the constant memory and being part of a culture
    that spans across the globe is something that I would find extremely worth doing. </p>

  <p>My goals in life are eventually to be able to work remotelty as a developer, reach my financial goals,and hop around from country to country for awhile. I hope to start a foundation for adopted children around the world to pay it forward.</p>
